# Stochastic Simulation of Antibiotic Resistance [S.A.R.]

**SAR** is a simulation package originally written to answer questions addressed in the manuscript titled *Genetic basis and patterns of gaining antibiotic resistance of a na√Øve strain of Staphylococcus aureus*, authored by S., A., and G. Abdel-Azim. While the antibiotic resistance phenomenon is well-documented, the pattern by which bacteria gain resistance remains unknown. The study analyzed the pattern of amoxicillin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus and, through the use of simulation, offered explanations for that pattern. In the lab, we found that bacteria gain resistance to antibiotics in a stepwise pattern. The simulation package was useful in providing evidence of a step-wise pattern caused by varying levels of complexity in the mutations that bacteria undergo to gain resistance. The various cell processes involved in the evolution of bacterial populations, such as population construction, population fitness adjustment, cell division, and mutation, were simulated to ascertain the trend of antibiotic resistance in bacteria. The ability to set unique initial bacterial population parameters provides flexibility in its usage.
